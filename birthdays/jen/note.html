            <p>For the last 18 days leading up to your birthday I've been writing a litle something of a time with you that day. This is beyond cheesy and super lame, but I thought it would be cool haha.</p>

This sounds horrible, but I'm grateful for your mom because without her you wouldn't be born. Glad for your existence in this wild, wild world :') 
<br>
Prom is a week away and we both have no idea what we're doing. 
<br>

Just met your mom today and she's super sweet. Definitely one of the cooler mom's out there.</p>

<p>Just got off the phone with you -- We talked about how we're getting to prom, where we're taking pictures, and what we're doing afterwards. All of our friends are butting heads on where to go afterwards it's crazy.
<br>
Had a great conversation about corsages and boutonnieres. Blue or gold? We're indecisive human beings. It's horrible. Go us.
<br>
Cosette is so cute, it was a pleasant surprise hearing her voice on the phone.</p>

You looked AMAZING, the decorations were great, you did an amazing job. <br>None of this would be coming true without you.

Thank you for tonight. I couldn't have asked for a better person to go with.
No matter what, please know that I will always have your back.

<p>Things have gotten weird and I'm so sorry about that. I respect you and your thoughts and I will definitely cherish the times we've had together. I can't tell if last night's talk was the wrong time or a relief. I'm lost in emotions and seriously hope we can be the same as we were before.</p>

    ONE MORE WEEK!!! ONE MORE WEEK! ONE MORE WEEK until you're 18! I hope you're hyped. 7 more days til adulthood.
<br><br>
I'm thinking of making you a Passion Pit: Manners / Gossamer and Bastille: Bad Blood / Wild World random animation album site, but not sure, but then again... you're also a paper typa person so paper card / craft might be the best thing? I don't know. I'll figure it out.

    June 11th is the APT Dance showcase. I want to go regardless if you're only going to be there for 5 minutes. I haven't gone to any of your competitions or performances the past 4 years.
<br>
Still worried about your well being. Being sick sucks.
<br>
Ordered Amazon pics, but they won't arrive til late June. . .
why? I don't know.</p>

Really looking forward to making this card. I have ideas but nothing solid.
<br>
I think I'm going to make a memory book type of thing with events from all of high school or even just this year because even in the past 2 months there's been a lot of memories.
<br><br>
Ideas: Smiski figure, trip to downtown San Francisco, Bastille concert, Prom
<br>I hate whoever made this wild world communications logo -- WHY IS IT SO HARD TO DRAW AND CUT
